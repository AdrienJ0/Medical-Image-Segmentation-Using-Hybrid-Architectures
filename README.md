# 2. Informations of the sub-repositories

## 2.1. ParaPVTCNN

This repository contains the code to train and test the ParaPVTCNN architecture which was implemented based on the ParaTransCNN architecture. It is inspired from this github repo: https://github.com/hongkunsun/paratranscnn

## 2.2. TransUNet

This repo contains the code in order to train and test the TransUNet architecture on the Synapse Dataset. It is inspired from this github repo: https://github.com/Beckschen/TransUNet/tree/main

## 2.3. SwinUNet

This repo contains the code in order to train and test the SwinUNet architecture on the Synapse dataset. It is inspired from this github repo: https://github.com/HuCaoFighting/Swin-Unet

## 2.4. UNet

This repo contains the code in order to train and test the UNet architecture on the Synapse dataset. It is inspired from this github repo: https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet/tree/67bf11b4db4c5f2891bd7e8e7f58bcde8ee2d2db/unet

## 2.5. GUI

This repo contains the code for a graphical interface. On this interface, the physician will load a CT-Scan as input and obtain its segmentation predicted by a chosen model.
